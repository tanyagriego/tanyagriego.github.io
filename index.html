    <h2>Should I stop feeding stray cats?</h2>
    <p>
      There is a feral cat living right next to my house, I don't want some idiot to have her put down, so I was wondering how I would go about adopting her.
      Her life has value and I don't want anything bad to happen to her, she has a right to a life.
      Do I go to my local cat shelter and 'hey, I found this feral cat, can I adopt her?' Or something else.
      Update: I'm 24 and live in my own home, and yes that cat deserves a life, she is not a pest, you are.
      Update 2: btw, I went out bought some stuff (cat food, bowls, litter tray), brought her into my house and cleaned her up a bit, I've made an appointment with the vets.
      She has a right to a life, and I will give her that right.

  <h2>Do some cats lay eggs?</h2>
  <p>
    No. Cats do not lay eggs. They are mammals, and MOST mammals do not lay eggs, the only exception are the 5 species of monotremes, which include the Platypus and 4 species of Echidnas.

  <br>Catbirds lay eggs, but they are birds.
